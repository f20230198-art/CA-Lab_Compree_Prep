## 🚀 What You'll Learn

After going through this repository, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Write MIPS assembly programs from scratch
- ✅ Handle strings, arrays, and procedures
- ✅ Implement loops, recursion, and branching
- ✅ Solve any lab exam question confidently

---

## 📝 Important Notes

- All code tested and working
- Follow the order: Basics → Advanced → PYQ
- Practice writing code without looking at solutions
- Understand the logic, don't just memorize

---

## 🎯 Exam Tips

1. **Read question 2-3 times** before coding
2. **Write structure first** (.data, .text, main)
3. **Use comments** for partial credit
4. **Don't forget** to exit with `li $v0, 10; syscall`
5. **Test mentally** with small example values
